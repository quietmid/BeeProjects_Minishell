# Minishell

## Project Description

The objective of Minishell is to create functioning shell program that can handle most of the commands and input like bash does. During the process, we learned a lot of how bash parse inputs, how processes and file descriptors work. This was a group project and I worked on with the super chill Paul (https://github.com/pbumi).

## Core Features
- Parsing a string of commands
- Executing the commands
- Expander '$'
- Pipe, redirect and Execute
- env variables
